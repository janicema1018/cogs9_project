Hello.
Because I am.
I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.
Well, I’m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.
Soon. See, I could’ve said in the near future, but I didn’t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already.
Gentlemen, I’ve got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?
These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever I’m thirsty I have access to water. When I’m hungry, I have lentil soup.
Run down the pros and cons of each for me.
Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.
Ah, I’m back, you got me for eight minutes.
The coefficient isn’t lambda, it’s lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?
It’s five and a half.
BRB. That’s short for be right back. I’m saving so much time.
The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.
You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That’ll never work. Spoiler, works.
Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler, way.
Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack.
Well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?
Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasn’t stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants.
Of course not. I’m too busy to be sick.
I’m fine.
That didn’t happen.
Just do your laundry.
I am fine. Here, eat your toast. (Sneezes) Sorry.
Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. It’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix.
What I need is to get to work.
What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?
What’s going on? How’d I get here?
Home from work? What time is it?
Nine o’clock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?
Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine to… I took cold medicine.
At, at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?
My pants are missing, I don’t remember anything. Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?
Leonard, would you be a lamb?
Wait, wait. Where’s my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag.
Where’s my notebook? My notebook’s gone. Oh, no.
What’s the big deal? It’s full of classified information about the air force project.
That’s it. I’m in breach of my security clearance. I’m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor.
I’m trying.
Why?
What does it say?
Where?
I, no, that is preposterous. Maybe.
It’s hard to say.
It’s getting clearer.
Uh, no, thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.
Um, yes. Howdy, partner. Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?
It’s called fitting in. By the way, good luck.
Oh, thank goodness.
I swear.
Not to tell anyone.
The top secret military information I’m about to tell you.
We really need to skedaddle. Thank you.
Thank you for making me tea.
Yummy. And warm on my back.
You know exactly what I need.
That’s nice. Now in German.
Great. Now Mandarin.
Now Navajo.
