Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.
Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking.
Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.
They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.
Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?
Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.
Quantum physics makes me so happy.
It’s like looking at the universe naked. (Shivers)
Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up.
Yes.
Knock, knock.
Interrupting physicist.
MUON!
Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!
Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.
Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.
Oh dear Lord. No!
They’re mint in box.
Is someone there?
Spock?
Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
But it’s mint in box.
Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response.
To be played with.
Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it.
Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? (Wakes up in bed) Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I’m so excited, but this is wrong. I’m gonna do it. I’m doing it. I did it. Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. (Spins toy). Energise. (Tries to spin toy. It sticks. Tries to get Spock out and toy falls apart.) Don’t be broken. Please don’t be broken. (To Spock toy) What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. (Sees Leonard’s toy) It’s only logical.
Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
What is it now, tiny Spock?
You’re the one who told me to play with it.
No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.
Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy.
I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.
You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here.
Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. (Throws Spock away. Get’s attacked by a Gorn. Wakes up.) Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.
Oh, I don’t want a broken toy. (Switches them back again. Penny and Leonard enter.) Nothing!
Nothing. I said nothing.
Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.
My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.
Mmmmm!
Oh, nice job, man-hands.
Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart.
Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you.
I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.
My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie.
Yes.
Okay. Leonard, even though I don’t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.
Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.
