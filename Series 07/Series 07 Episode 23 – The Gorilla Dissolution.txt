I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.
I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.
Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.
I know.
Thanks for coming with me.
I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.
Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?
That was awkward, right?
Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?
Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.
No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?
Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?
Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
Slick, huh?
Have you had intercourse?
Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.
An interesting question. Well, good night.
That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.
How many women have you had dates with?
How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
Sure.
Well, now do you see the problem?
I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.
