Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.
You’re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.
Oh, Penny? Penny?
Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.
Correct.
You’re two for two.
Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.
Yes.
That’s ridiculous.
Because…
It’s my office.
All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.
Well, you really want to dot the I’s and cross the T’s, don’t you?
They do some of their best work at night.
(Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Penny opens door. Howard is stood outside with a hand-held voice recorder.) Penny?
One question.
Why on earth are you telling me all this?
This isn’t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
It’s actually British.
Brobdingnagian.
Brobdingnagian.
Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?
All right, you’ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
All right, if you’re not going to remove it, I’ll remove it for you.
Help me move my desk.
Yes.
Yes.
Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
All right, I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.
Stand by for my upcoming tat.
Yes?
I’ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
That’s it! Prepare for marshmallow death!
Yes?
I’m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.
Well, we’ll just see how long you can hold out.
Yes.
Highly. Oh, dear. (Explosion)
