Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!
Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.
Yes.
Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.
Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.
Of course I do.
It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.
As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.
Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.
Leonard, are you in bed?
Me, too.
I can’t sleep.
Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?
I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
Do you have cufflinks?
Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?
I still can’t sleep.
I’m getting worried.
Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress. (Phone rings) It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.
The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.
Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you.
Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.
Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
I am.
Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.
Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?
Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.
Yes.
Potato clock. Do potato clock.
What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.
Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446
I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?
Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.
But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
I’ll do it.
Oh, yeah.
Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever.
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
Want me to sing it again?
There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?
Name it.
Oh, you’re not. You look awful.
Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?
So, in a way it’s like I’m your son.
Father.
