For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.
Interesting hypothesis. Let’s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.
It’s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?
Oh, well.
What kind of tea would you like?
Two tea bags in one cup? You’re not at a rave.
I couldn’t agree more.

R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.
Okay, I’m gonna let that slide because I know you’re hopped up on tea bags.

Night of the Living Garlic Bread?
I’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.

Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I’ll try it.
Look at that, the problem solved itself.
What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?
No, I don’t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it’s a lost cause.
What’s a hickey?
I should’ve picked hickey.
It was a compromise. I lost.
