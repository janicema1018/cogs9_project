So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.
Oh, you caught that, did you?
Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.
Oh, no, no. That’s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend.
Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let’s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.
Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.
Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let’s knock them off.
Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?
Next.
Mmm.
But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.
Well, I hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.
Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.
I think I’ll keep it for myself.
It’s too late. I call dibs.
Hello.
Okay. Shall we go to dinner?
Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day.
What is that?
Really?
More than anything.
Well, I don’t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. And that’s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.
No. No, after everything you didn’t do for me tonight, I want you to have it.
Read it.
At the bottom.
Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?
It’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend.
Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine’s Day and order my pizza.
