You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.
Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels.
Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.
For the record, giant rats are possible.
Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.
But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.
Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.
That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock.
We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.
Sarcasm?
Remember, seven o’clock.
Pacific Daylight time!
Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
These are my own bowling shoes.
I know where my feet have been.
Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.
I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?
Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good.
Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.
A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. (Gets a strike) Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.
(Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.
This is for you.
I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.
If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.
No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.
I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.
You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that.
When are you going to talk to him?
He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.
All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here.
Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.
No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”
It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley.
What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
No, it’s not the… Never mind.
Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.
Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?
No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.
All right.
I so loathe you.
That’s not even from your franchise!
Be the ball, Howard.
You weren’t the ball.
Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.
Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.
Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card.
Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.
All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball.
Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!
Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!
You did this, didn’t you?
No, I suppose not.
Wheaton!
