Leonard, she’s doing it again.
No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
Leonard.
Hello.
Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating.
Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.
Oh, sure. And while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?
Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
My mother was right. Hell is real.
Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels. (Raj whispers to him) While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.
Howard?
Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
Bazinga. I don’t care.
That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
Just need a little more practice.
It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go through that again.
Then speak.
All right. (To Raj) Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy.
A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.
Why can’t Leonard teach you?
Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.
Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.
Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?
The one with the frogs.
I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so.
Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.
Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.
Research journal, entry one. I’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla.
Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.
One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where’s your notebook?
How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
How else are you gonna study for the tests?
Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too intimidating.
You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.
Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?
This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?
Can’t you hold it?
Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.
Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?
No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!
Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?
How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
I’m sorry. (Smiling) Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?
All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?
Greece.
There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?
No.
No.
Oh!
Why are you crying?
That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.
All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.
A good question.
And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?
It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
Is it morning?
Then I’ve been up all night.
Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.
I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.
You’re right. (Takes whiteboard to window and throws it out. Picks up a new one) It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.
Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…
Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
Structure, constant structure. One atom…
Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…
Not lima beans, carbon atoms.
Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.
Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!
The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?
I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.
They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
Impaired cognitive function.
But I don’t want to go to bed.
Oh, all right.
Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.
But I’m still working.
You can try, but you’ll never catch me. (He disappears under the balls)
Bazinga. (Disappears, pops up in another place) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga.
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.
I have good news.
Your cell phone was off.
And that didn’t work out, did it?
I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.
No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.
Einstein.
Albert Einstein.
When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.
Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.
Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back.
No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard.
A menial job. Like yours.
I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?
Shouldn’t you check your database?
You didn’t really type.
Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.
I could do that.
One question.
What’s sheetrock?
That seems acceptable.
I don’t drive.
Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory.
Behind you.
I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.
A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.
Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.
Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.
All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit.
Yes.
Of course.
Nope.
Yep.
I do.
Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I’ve been looking at it all wrong. I can’t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It’s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
I’m sorry. I don’t work here.
Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.
Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
You’re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.
Why not?
Pay attention, Leonard. That’s why she can’t play on Sunday.
Your turn, Leonard.
Roll the dice, Leonard.
Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?
I’ll just roll for you.
Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
It’s also your roll.
Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?
Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.
It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?
All right, I’ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.
Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.
Leonard! Stop the car!
I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
Come on, come on, we’re late.
I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.
Go, go, Power Rangers, go!
No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.
All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. Have a nice evening.
Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies.
Got it.
Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ I’d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, ’cause I’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! Stop yelling! You’re making Sheldon cry! I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.
This is a restaurant. It’s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm.
No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.
I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.
I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
Excuse me, miss. I’d like to order lunch.
I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?
Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?
You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich.
Of course not. I’ll have my usual.
Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.
Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
I don’t follow.
All right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.
Considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?
Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.
That’s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it.
Because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper.
And she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
Oh, good, you’re home. I need you to do me a favour.
Go apologize to Penny.
Right now would be good.
Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.
(Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.
Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you.
I’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.
Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?
I want that one.
Can I get this comic book, too?
I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
Uh-oh.
I was going to get my mail.
I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.
Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.
Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends.
Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain.
Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse.
Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve.
Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
Bazinga.
He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.
I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat.
I’m hungry now.
Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).
I was talking with Penny.
Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
Which one picks last?
Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair.
Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!
Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?
Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!
Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!
Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk.
I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye.
Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first.
I can’t think of a reason why not.
Hold on. Nope, no reason.
All right, say hello to your mother for me.
What?
I didn’t say outside.
No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.
Which way are you going?
I’m going the other way. Bye.
No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.
Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
I shall. Have a nice scoot.
Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!
(Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life.
Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian.
Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.
I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention.
Do you have a stomach ache, too?
No.
Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
Well, my new shoes are not made for running.
No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
You can’t cook and you made me this.
Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell.
I told you, walking.
I got lost.
Satellites are down. Solar flares.
Yes, there are.
I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
Maybe this isn’t a good time.
Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
You may want to sit down.
Point taken. You may want to sit up.
I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.
We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?
I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.
I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.
Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?
Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.
And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.
We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you.
I can still eat.
Okay, but just don’t fight
Thank you, Penny.
No, Goofy, no.
Sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. (He laughs)
And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m going to be dining alone this evening, so I’ll be reducing my usual order. I’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.
I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store. (At Penny’s door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny..
Penny?
(At Penny’s bedroom door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny..
Shall I come back at a better time?
Hello.
Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
Tubs are slippery.
I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
They’re holding umbrellas.
The ducks in my tub.
They’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.
Well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.
I don’t drive.
Well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse.
But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.
All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.
I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?
My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
That doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if I’m driving.
Okay, here.
All right.
We should have you checked for a concussion.
All right.
Don’t look?
Oh. Well, that’s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.
They always look. It never ends well.
Ok.
It doesn’t feel like an arm.
All righty.
For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.
Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.
Didn’t work out well.
One moment. According to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There’s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?
Where is the passenger side mirror?
Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I’m going to have to start again.
Oh, I think we’re going sufficiently fast. What’s that?
That can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.
All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.
Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?
Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
No, it isn’t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.
Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.
All right, there’s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.
All right. And how did the accident occur?
Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
Kidney disease?
Migraines?
Are you currently pregnant?
Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.
When was your last menstrual period?
I’ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.
Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
Possible Tourette’s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.
I’m sorry. There, there. Everything’s going to be fine. Sheldon’s here.
Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.
Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
That’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.
“Soft Kitty” is for when you’re sick. You’re not sick.
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?
Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.
Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.
The parade.
Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate.
Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession.
And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.
Forgive me, as you know, I’m no adept at reading facial cues, but I’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated.
I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged.
Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.
I’m sorry.
Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.
And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.
That’s happy, right?
Nailed it.
Gentlemen.
Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?
I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…
I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.
For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
For me.
Of course I’m busy.
Yes, please. (After about 30 seconds) How may I help you?
For me.
I’m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.
I reject them all.
I’m sorry, I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview.
Please.
So, that’s what you wear to an interview?
Oh, pulling strings, are we?
Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.
I’m the boss. I make the jokes.
This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.
What?
Top desk drawer.
Alright?
Good.
Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
Astro means star.
English is your native language.
There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
Caca?
All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…
In this context, with me means for me.
Oh! If I’m wrong, prove it.
No, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target.
You’re defacing my work.
Give me the eraser.
I said give it to me.
Fine. (Uses hand as an eraser. Then realises his hand is dirty) Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!
I am in every way.
(Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.
Doing what? (Performs finger trick again) All right, you’ve made your point.
I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
I didn’t say that.
Nevertheless, I didn’t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.
In this context for me could mean with me.
I reject them all.
Wait, you have to drive me home.
I walked.
I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.
Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!
Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.
I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?
Oh, that certainly would suck.
Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line.
Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.
You’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.
Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
Victory!
Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you.
Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture. (Sings) I have your kite. I have your kite.
It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.
If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken.
Football or chicken-fried meats?
If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.
That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.
Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
Fine.
Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.
That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.
When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?
Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.
Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.
Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?
How would you put it?
Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.
Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
What’s funny about Cylon toast?
(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.
Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread.
You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.
So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?
You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?
I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
I should’ve brought an umbrella.
I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.
One of my best, don’t you think?
Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?
How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
Not my world.
I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.
I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.
Hello.
Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’.
See, now this is a man for Penny.
No, it’s not.
Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.
Make it so.
I was wrong. Penny can do better.
He must be very skilled at coitus.
I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
All right, let me restate that. It’s very heavy, and I don’t want to.
Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.
What’s going on?
Oh! Not this again.
In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.
When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?
FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.
As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.
Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.
Counting this instance? 317.
She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
Who’s going to tell whom about what?
Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
Be more specific.
That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.
It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.
I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.
Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.
Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you.
He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
I don’t drink coffee.
As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.
What’s life without whimsy?
You’re bluffing.
Curse you.
In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?
Haughty derision it is.
Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.
Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.
May I buy you a beverage?
Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?
I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
I did.
Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.
Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.
Tandoori Palace?
You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?
Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…
If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.
I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. (Howard indicates that he has got it.) Oh, good! Now I can eat.
Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.
In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06.
Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.
That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
I can’t take your money.
I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
Thank God.
Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
All right, you have a wager.
I don’t see anything.
One at a time. (Same thing happens again. Eventually they leave the apartment. There is a growling noise.) What was that?
Help me open it.
Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?
If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.
Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here.
His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.
Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.
Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long.
We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.
He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy. (They leave)
Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome
Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?
I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
I’m sorry?
No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?
Told you.
No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.
Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.
Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
Penny, I’d rather not talk about it.
Why would that make me feel better?
Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken.
A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
Well, I wish I could.
Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?
I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
Hello.
Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
 Yes.
Hardly.
Have I crossed some sort of line again?
Hmm. Oh, who cares?
Hold.
Explain your sneeze.
Do you have allergies?
Is there too much pepper on your salad?
I’ve heard enough. Sit over there.
That’s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.
Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.
Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.
Sarcasm?
For your information, I’ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.
Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university.
I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto.
My room, of course.
Go ahead.
A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.
Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?
When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you’ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.
Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.
Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.
Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.
I’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.
Oh, good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.
Hello.
I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist.
No, she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?
Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.
No, he doesn’t understand. I understand.
You’re just misappropriating my understanding.
From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
Get it together, man.
All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.
The Original Series on a high-density flash drive.
Then there’s really no reason to live, is there?
He’s an odd duck, isn’t he?
Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.
Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
Sleep well, my friend.
Oh, let me just get one thing. It’s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there’s an apocalypse, good luck.
Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
Morning.
Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
Excuse me, I’m going to relieve myself.
Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.
All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.
Ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. I’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.
Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.
Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.
Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.
That’s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.
No.
The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
I must say, I’m shocked by this betrayal.
Not Penny, me!
Elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!
Dr. Plimpton, I’d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
And of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.
You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.
Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels.
Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.
For the record, giant rats are possible.
Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.
But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.
Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.
That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock.
We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.
Sarcasm?
Remember, seven o’clock.
Pacific Daylight time!
Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
These are my own bowling shoes.
I know where my feet have been.
Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.
I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?
Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good.
Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.
A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. (Gets a strike) Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.
(Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.
This is for you.
I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.
If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.
No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.
I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.
You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that.
When are you going to talk to him?
He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.
All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here.
Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.
No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”
It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley.
What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
No, it’s not the… Never mind.
Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.
Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?
No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.
All right.
I so loathe you.
That’s not even from your franchise!
Be the ball, Howard.
You weren’t the ball.
Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.
Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.
Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card.
Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.
All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball.
Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!
Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!
You did this, didn’t you?
No, I suppose not.
Wheaton!
I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?
Detailed analysis posted online.
It is great, isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.
Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.
I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s.
The zoot suit riots.
I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
That’s a semantically null sentence.
Well, that’s certainly amusing, but I have no interest.
If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?
Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.
One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland.
You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge.
Well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.
Tell her you’re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.
Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
I don’t drink.
I would like a root beer float.
They don’t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.
And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.
All right. There’s a female.
But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?
Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
Okay. What is your game?
When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.
It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
I’m Sheldon. How do you do?
I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry. (Smiles and nods)
Hello.
In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.
Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
We scored. I’m the wingman.
The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet. (There is a knock on the door) One minute. Sis  n.
It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I’d learn Finnish.
I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again.
Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.
Oh, my. I’ve admired these for years.
Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
Hulk sad.
You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it’s late.
Time for bed.
Good night, puny human! (He gets up and leaves).
Yes?
Well, I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night.
Actually, he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.
In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.
Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.
In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
This is incredible! I’m so happy, I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing.
Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?
Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?
What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
Sorry? I’ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
Shame on you! That’s no dream for a scientist!
Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.
Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.
Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.
He can’t kill me, even if I turn.
No, that seemed a little farfetched.
I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.
I’d be much further along if I’d been allowed to practice.
Is that your final decision?
Very well.
All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
You’re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.
He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.
Morning, old chum.
I’ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here’s Frodo.
Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.
It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.
I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you’re my friend.
Drat. No Frodo for you.
Hello.
Alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I’m here.
Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room.
It’s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.
Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.
No, it’s not. I’ve got five more slides.
Very well. Enjoy yourself. You’re going to be in the presence of something that I’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
You will?
Oh, Penny, thank you!
Since I rarely hug, I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration.
Oh, good. Bye-bye.
All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?
Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
Oh, but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?
Yes, that good news.
Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.
That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
Really?
Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.
I don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.
With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates’ house should I be invited.
Great. I’ll start packing. In a minute. (Vomits again) Oh, look, it’s the cholermus.
Chicken?
With the little stars?
Heated to 180 degrees?
You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick.
Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.
It’s you! I touched you!
Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.
Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.
Who’s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?
No, what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman.
Fascinating.
It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.
If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.
Mine!
Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.
Other than the lack of water, how is it not?
We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.
You mean my ring?
The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.
I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way.
I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
Looking for something?
Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!
 It’s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.
You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
No, it’s mine.
I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?
Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?
No! I call no Meemaws.
I don’t want to hear this.
Never.
Stop it!
I said stop it!
Waterfalls!
Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
Oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. I have to pee.
Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?
Excellent choice.
I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine! (He runs to the bathroom) We’re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. (He looks in the mirror and has turned into golem. He screams and wakes up, still on the settee.) Where’s the ring?
I knew it. Give us the precious!
Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
No, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.
I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!
Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.
Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
There’s doubt?
That’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.
There you go.
Good what?
Go ahead.
I can hear it!
I would hardly call that dialogue!
Don’t make me turn that flag upside down, ’cause you know I’ll do it!
I don’t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.
Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I’d call you when I got home, I’m not home yet. (Walks through door) Alright, I’m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I’m all but certain there’s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn’t say that. I’m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk.
Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye. (To his spot) Hello, old friend. (Sits) Daddy’s home.
I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won’t forget your contributions.
Of course, I can’t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.
Tell me what?
You fellows are planning a party for me, aren’t you?
If there’s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea.
If this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.
So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.
You tampered with my experiment?
Did Leonard know about this? Leonard’s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn’t know.
Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.
Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.
Hello, Penny. I realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?
Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
What’s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.
That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe.
You’re right, Leonard, it’s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal
About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn’t even get to go to Comic-Con!
That’s for when I’m sick. Sad is not sick.
I don’t have a sad song. I’m not a child.
Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?
I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.
It’s going to take more than I’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.
You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
All right, I’ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I’ m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.
My credibility may have been damaged…
But I would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man’s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.
Oh, you think you’re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.
Thanks, Mom.
Aw, Mom.
Fed.
Bread.
Grateful.
Plateful.
My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
They’re not my friends.
That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.
What are they doing here?
Evolution isn’t an opinion, it’s fact.
I forgive you. Let’s go home.
Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
Oh, I don’t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?
Well, look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now.
I’ve decided I’m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month’s Batman.
Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.
What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?
There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.
Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.
Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.
It bothers me.
A summons for what?
November 16? Penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.
Yes, it is.
Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.
Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?
So you betrayed me?
But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
I’m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I’m guilty.
I am not guilty. I only have a learner’s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.
You don’t need to reimburse me because I’m not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I’m going to begin preparing my defence right now.
Now you see what you’ve done? Because of you, we’re all going to miss Stan Lee.
Well, you’re my friends. You’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I’m victorious.
Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
Howard?
Raj? You’ll be there, won’t you? (Shirt plays “incorrect” quiz sound) All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness.
Please try to wear something appropriate. It won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.
That’s just wrong.
Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I’d like to call on your skills as an actress.
I’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?
Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?
Excellent. Go on.
And who performed that heroic act?
There’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.
Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.
Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself.
And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I’d like to begin with an opening statement.
Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.
Thank you.
I object. You’re completely ignoring the law.
Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.
I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
That’s my spot.
Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?
I need to use the restroom.
That’s the toilet?
Please tell the judge I’m ready to apologize.
You know very well how it went.
I was found guilty and fined $533.
I also now have three points on a driver’s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.
You had gelato with Stan Lee?
Well, I hope you’re satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.
Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.
No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!
This is Stan Lee’s front door. We were on Stan Lee’s curb, then we were on Stan Lee’s walk, and now we’re at Stan Lee’s front door.
Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee’s doorbell. At Stan Lee’s house. We’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.
We’re not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.
You said we were invited.
Well, I’m not much of a sports fan, but thank you.
I’ll tell you where I’ve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.
Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.
I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?
I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?
Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…
Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.
My thank you was not sincere.
Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I’m sorry you had to hear that.
Yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.
Thank you. My mother is very excited. She’s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.
All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
Hello.
Excuse me, may I interject?
Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.
Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.
My pleasure, Ira.
Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.
No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.
A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!
I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I’m doing?
What do you want?
It wasn’t funny.
Did you laugh?
I refuse to sink to his level.
I never admit defeat.
However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.
Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.
It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.
Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not.
All right, how’s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.
Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.
Yes, exactly.
Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.
You flatter me, sir.
The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.
It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.
There is no abort.
I made a boo-boo, all right?
Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you’d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.
No.
Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.
The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.
It’s Oatmeal Day.
Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?
Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.
It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment.
I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition
I want oatmeal.
I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.
I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”
What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.
You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?
Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday.
Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…
I’m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.
Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate
You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
You know, I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.
Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?
Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate.
And it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime.
You’re here a lot now.
Thank you. Chocolate?
Really?
Very good. Chocolate?
Actually, it turns out I can.
There’s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.
I’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.
Are you saying that I’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?
Bad Leonard.
Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.
If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.
No, of course not. We’re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.
Oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.
You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?
Sheldon You wouldn’t prefer a throaty chuckle?
No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.
Come again?
Freaky?
Have a chocolate.
Well, I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum.
Thank you. (Throws a chocolate. Penny catches it in her mouth)
Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.
No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.
Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.
Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.
I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.
Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree.
December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.
I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why.
No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you.
If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate.
If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.
Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.
No trouble at all.
My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.
August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
You did.
Neither do I, but it’s the social convention.
It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…
Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.
September 22nd.
She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?
I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.
It’s a conversation starter.
Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate.
What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.
That’s not the comforting part.
No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.
Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.
If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night.
Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
You’re very welcome.
I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated.
I blame Penny.
Agreed.
It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.
Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.
From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.
Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.
June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.
You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
I’m sorry, no.
Yes, I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I’ll add a guest napkin, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for you today. (Leonard steals a napkin) Good luck. That’s the face napkin.
I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.
That would probably save us some time.
I’m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.
I have money.
How does it different from the money I have?
Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
But I must have it.
Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.
Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:
You don’t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.
I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.
It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.
In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.
From hell’s heart, I stab at thee.
My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!
Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.
Silence!
I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’
Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
Luminescence spell.
Fire demon.
Three-headed lion.
Brimstone.
You’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.
The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.
You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.
Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.
No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.
Oh, yes.
I can’t.
No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.
I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?
Wheaton! Wheaton! Wheaton!
Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.
Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso’s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It’s now under chicken.
Yes, General Tso.
So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?
Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.
Good idea. We’ll go to Corleone’s.
You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster.
It was listed under seafood.
Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?
The TV is gone.
Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It’s all right. They didn’t take my comic books.
They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.
Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman.
When does the CSI team get here?
In anticipation of their arrival, I’ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.
I’m sorry, Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.
I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
I’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?
Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.
Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.
The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
Oh, how I wish I could.
I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.
We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?
Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
All right, then. Good night.
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.
Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.
May I come in?
I see you’re drinking wine.
Uh-huh.
Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch.
It’s not what I want, it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.
I do tonight. It’s scary over there.
Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?
All right. I’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
Bad idea.
Listen to her, Jim.
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny!
What if they cut the power?
What if someone steals my keys?
What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?
Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.
Better.
Sheldon’s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I’ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo. (Hears a noise. Goes to check, then panics and climbs out window onto ledge.) Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder. (Crawls along to Leonard’s window, where Leonard and Penny are inside being intimate. Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.
I heard a noise.
Why would you knock over a lamp?
Oh! No, she’s right, I don’t need to know what you were doing. Carry on. (Starts to climb back out of window)
Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?
Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.
I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder.
My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don’t like that.
Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I’m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that’s overreacting.
Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.
All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you’re from Nebraska, correct?
It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.
I sense you’re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.
I am moving on. I’m going to be a Bozite.
They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
Please, Penny, as you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.
Greetings. As you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.
You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn’t Bozeman.
That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!
Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce. (Man picks up bags and starts running.) Wait! Wait! Excuse me! (At ticket desk) One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.
Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn’t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?
And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?
I won?
I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.
Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please.
Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call (aside) three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don’t want to forfeit the award? Well, you’ve got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you. (Hangs up) Problem.
They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can’t give a speech.
I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
I’m not accepting the award.
Thank you. Yeah, I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.
Am I? Let me tell you a story.
I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it… oh, dear. (He faints.)
Don’t trample me.
Come on, Mother, you know why I can’t accept the award. With all due respect, I don’t think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. Yes, I’ll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother. (Enters apartment. The others are sitting as if waiting for him.) Hello.
Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?
Oh, I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way, and I’m much smarter than all of you.
Oh, I’m sorry, that is what I meant.
I do like the X-Men.
I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men, what are your powers?
That’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?
What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.
And I appreciate the pretence.
No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.
And yet, you can’t speak to women.
Okay, but don’t punch me.
When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me.
That’s what my sister used to say.
I’m sorry. Proceed.
Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.
Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?
I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
Really? This time of year? It’s a bit nippy.
Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount.
Look, I didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.
Hang on. It’s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no.
A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror! (Sound of door slamming) Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.
I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
It’s only one colour.
That’s a lot of money for only one colour.
Hmm. (Cut to Sheldon exiting changing room in a loud check suit). This is pretty sharp.
This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six. (Cut to Sheldon exiting in a white dinner suit with tails) Okay, I think we have a winner.
In the prom department.
Says the former member of the Corn Queen’s Court.
Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison. (Goes into changing room. Comes out in black suit looking terrific.) This is absurd. I look like a clown.
That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s.
Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.
I was wearing size a million pants.
Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.
Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.
And how did that make you feel?
Go on.
So, I hear you saying you’re angry with your mother.
Thank you, Leonard.
If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony.
Oh, dear.
I’m getting dizzy.
I can’t do this. I’m going to faint.
Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol.
I don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective.
I’m ready.
Thanks, shorty,I’ll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked. (Singing) There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,
Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I’m having about the events of last night?
Question one, where are my pants?
What do I search?
Oh, Lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating.
