1. Each series folder contains Sheldon's lines in each episode in that series and a combined file putting together all Sheldon's lines in that series.

2. main.py file is the web-scraping part, using selenium and chromedriver to extract all Sheldon's lines and format them.

3. combine_lyrics_season.py file loops through all episode files in each folder and combines them into one file containing all Sheldon's lines for a certain series.

4. frequency.py file contains the code that we originally wrote to form a customized word cloud, but it doesn't work out well. 

5. scatter.ipynb contains the code for creating scatterplots, plotting the best fit line and calculating the summary stats.
