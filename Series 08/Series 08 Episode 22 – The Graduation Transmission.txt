If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed.
Aren’t you afraid of being blinded?
At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.
Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.
And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.
All right.
It actually says at least?
Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?
You see where I’m going with this.
All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they’re still getting at least one angry letter.
Initiating rotation sequence. Don’t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?
Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. It’s a good thing I didn’t send that letter.
Yay.
We did it. Oh, if it’s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.
Oh, no.
Won’t that void the warranty?
You know what they all do, right?
What about this one?
Not very.
So, can you get it working?
I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.
Hello.
Well, don’t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn’t originate in a Russian man’s colon.
You can’t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.
Very impressive. You know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn’t make smoke anymore.
Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.
Wrong. Obesity.
Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.
Whoa.
You call tech support.
Check.
Check.
That’s what my train used to do.
It is awful, isn’t it? Listen to that noise.
Then who is?
Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera’s working. Oh, look, it’s me.
Yes, it’s a robot uprising. Call the police.
Don’t worry, everyone in here is safe.
