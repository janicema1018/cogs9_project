I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
Well, one of the things.
Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway.
You’re right, you did kind of kill the mood.
Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.
Whenever you’re ready.
Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance.
What happened?
Been there.
Amy’s mad at me, and I’m not clear why.
Yes.
Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.
Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.
It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.
Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.
Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.
Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.
If that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.
No, and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now.
Too slow?
That’s right. It’s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.
Hello.
But you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date.
Okay.
Okay. If you say so.
Okay.
Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.
Things are good right now.
Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.
Seriously? Airborne worms?
You still didn’t pick a date.
I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions.
Well, look at that, even when I’m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?
Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?
So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining, isn’t it?
It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.
My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.
After all these years. I’m really happy for the two of you.
Now get out of my spot.
Hello. Listen, I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…
Strongly disagree. Go on.
Oh.
Okay.
Well, Gollum, you’re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?
