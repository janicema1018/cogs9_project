Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.
Yes, I’m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I’ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.
Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube.
Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.
Oh, you’re welcome.
You know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with Mrs. Cooper.
Wu-wu, what? That’s what I called you till I got to know you better.
Well, actually, I…
Excuse me, I take care of him.
Yeah, and Leonard’s mother’s already here.
Mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire.
I don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great.
Isn’t this nice?
Dr. Hofstadter.
All right, now I’m starting to sense a little tension.
Mom.
It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.
I’m not sorry. That’s true.
Don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking.
Yeah, I do. They’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal.
If I’d known you were broke, I wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread.
That’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man.
See, that’s funny because…
I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.
She’s still not answering.
I don’t like this at all.
